A series of historical maritime books for young readers set in South Asia.

I plan this as a set of four books to start.

1. Andaman Sea.  Set during the reign of Rajendra Chola - around 1100 CE, this features a trading voyage to the islands and ports of the Srivijaya kingdom to the east. The protagonist is a young boy from a trading family who is exposed to adventures way outside of his normal experience.
2. Bay of Bengal.  Set towards the later years of Ashoka's reign around 250 BC  this features a royal entourage being sent by the Emperor from a port in Kalinga to the court of Sri Lanka.  The protagonist is a young boy from Kalinga who is training to be a monk.
3. Persian Gulf.  Set during the Indus Valley civilization - arround 2000 BC, this features a trading expedition in a small craft from a port at the head of the Gulf of Cambay to a port up the Tigris-Euphrates river.  The protagonist is a young boy with an apittude for astronomy.
4. Arabian Sea. Set during the time of the discovery of sea routes to India from Europe - around 1450 CE, this features a military operation by an Indian naval fleet against Dutch ships.  The protagonist is a young boy with an ear for languages.
